Concepts
	- In order to sell the Drugs you grew You must sell them
	at a Shop setup in the other gangs territory
	- You Pick a Gang In the beginning of the Game
	- If you decide to switch gangs You lose your rank, your money,
	and everything you every owned.
	- In order to grow drugs you need to Have access to a farmer, who is
	the only person able to grow drugs.
	- You Dont have to rank up (It is Optional)
	- The Hitmen Make there Money By Killing People With Bounties On their head
	- Bounties Can Be placed By players or If sometimes the server will place bounties
	on people depending on their suspicious activity or threat level.
	- When Killed, you get demoted One level 
	- Some Farmers Can sign Contracts With Certain Druglords, the drug lords offer the farmers a price.
	- You can Sell your Drugs One by One and make more money, or sell them Stack by Stack and make less money 
	but reduce the chance of getting killed.
	- BoneMeal is Disabled
	- Maybe add a threat level? Like the more runs you do the better Chance
	you have by getting caught by the server and getting all your money
	and property stripped away, or just adding a bounty to your head. But not your rank
	- Your threat level goes up every 10% you complete a trip and your Threat Bar goes up to one-hundred percent
	- Ways you can help that is pay (x amount of money) To make it so you only get 5% Threat Per trip
	- Or for (x amount of money, which is a lot) you can get totally rid of the Threat Bar
	- If you dont want to pay ingame money You have to wait for your Threat Level to go down by "Cooling Off"
	which is waiting and every (x amount of time) your threat goes down 10%
	-(If you have anymore ideas add Here)
